Getting Started

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you'll need Python 3.8 or above along with key libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, NLTK, and PyWavelets.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies listed in the requirements file.

## Running the Project
Data Preprocessing: Begin by cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing features for model training.
Model Training: Train the machine learning models using the prepared data.
Evaluation: Evaluate the models' performance on a test dataset, analyzing accuracy and generating classification reports.
Prediction: Use the trained models to predict the genres of new movies.
Project Results

The project explores multiple machine learning models, including LSTM and CNN, to identify the best-performing approach for genre classification. The final models are saved for future use, and the project achieved promising accuracy on the test dataset.
